## About 

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Pediatrics, and Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/giovanni-parmigiani/). I completed my postdoctoral training in Biomedical Informatics at VUMC with [Dr. Paul Harris](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/paul-harris-phd-facmi-fiahsi).

Previously, I received my M.S. in Biostatistics from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and B.S. in Statistics from University of California, Davis.

<!--
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
