I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/) with secondary appointments in the Department of Pediatrics and Biostatistics. I received my Ph.D. in [Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/), where I was advised by [Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/giovanni-parmigiani/). I completed my postdoctoral training in Biomedical Informatics at VUMC with [Dr. Paul Harris](https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/person/paul-harris-phd-facmi-fiahsi).

I specialize in statistical machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and methods for estimating personalized treatment effects. My research focuses on the development and application of novel statistical ML and AI methods to advance precision medicine and accelerate diagnosis for patients with rare diseases.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
